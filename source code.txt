INITIAL DATA LOADING:

library(knitr)
library(caret)
library(party)
library(randomForest)
train_dat <- read.csv('~/r project/train.csv)
train_dat$Survived <- factor(train_dat$Survived, levels=c(0,1), labels=c('DIED', 'SURVIVED'))

set.seed(42)
train_idx <- createDataPartition(train_dat$Survived, p=0.75, list=F, times=1)

model_dat <- train_dat[train_idx,]
val_dat <- train_dat[-train_idx,]




INITIAL SOLUTION EXPLAINATION:

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
simple_survival_ctree <- ctree(Survived ~ Age + Sex + Pclass, data=model_dat, 
                               controls=ctree_control(testtype="Bonferroni"))
plot(simple_survival_ctree)
val_dat$ctree_preds <- predict(simple_survival_ctree, newdata=val_dat, type='response')




INITIAL SOLUTION ANALYSIS:

confusionMatrix(val_dat$ctree_preds, val_dat$Survived, positive="SURVIVED")



REVISED SOLUTION AND ANAYLSIS:


better_survival_ctree <- ctree(Survived ~ Age + Sex + Pclass + Fare + Parch + SibSp, data=model_dat, 
                               controls=ctree_control(testtype="Bonferroni"))
plot(better_survival_ctree)
val_dat$v2_ctree_preds <- predict(better_survival_ctree, newdata=val_dat, type='response')
confusionMatrix(val_dat$v2_ctree_preds, val_dat$Survived, positive="SURVIVED")
